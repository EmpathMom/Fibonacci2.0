# Fibonacci2.0

<h1 align="center">Fibonacci 2.0 </h1>


I took a while to do this I turned a problem I couldn't get to work and I added Class and Method and created a harder problem But, I stuck with working on it until..... 
the syntax was correct and there were no errors I started working on it at 5 pm and I did not stop until 9:30 pm when it finally ran.
 My biggest challenge was understanding formatting where to put what to make sure it worked. I think I need to make a flow chart to make this much easier and add detailed explanation. 

  at 35 years old with a ADHD and Dyslexia you can still learn.
  be patient with yourself.
  I'll eventually add to my bio  about what its like trying to learn a logical skill
  when you face challenges you cant change.
